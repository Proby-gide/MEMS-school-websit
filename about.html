                            <p><strong>Founder:</strong> Sri Basavaraj L Totager<br>
                                <strong>President of Malatesh Education Society</strong><br>

                            </p>

                            <p>The Shree Malatesh English Medium School was founded back in the year 2010 with a clear
                                idea to provide quality and holistic education to our future generation. This school was
                                established with the great motive to nurturing the most skill-full and creative minds of
                                the society and we have been working in the same direction for years.</p>

                            <p>We provide them the knowledge pertaining to every subjects/fields in their life. Our
                                curriculum is designed in such a way that it helps students develop comprehensive
                                understanding and practical skills.</p>

                            <p>At our school we strive to equip our children with qualities and moral that are needed to
                                face upcoming challenges in future life. We train students to be self confident,
                                courageous and helpful in all scenarios. Developing humane behaviour and leadership
                                qualities and imparting career oriented education is considered as most priority.</p>

                            <p>We know the significance of the homely school environment. So we maintain healthy home
                                school relationship for the better development of the students. We encourage teachers
                                and parents to interact with each other about the behaviour, performance and
                                achievements of the students.</p>

                            <p>We ourselves feel blessed for working towards the noble deed of education. I feel pride
                                and honour when I look back and observe what we served to the society and this is
                                combined effort of us and the teachers and parents.</p>
